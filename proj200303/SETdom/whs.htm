<pre><tt>Hi, Huang Yu.

I hope everything goes fine with you in US.

Dong Aiwu passed to me your email message. I tried to dump the SETdb as 
you suggested, but the computer did not recognize pgdump. What should I 
do?

Concerning the sequence analysis, the first step has to be the 
clarification of the genes (proteins) in the genome. I enclosed a table 
as example for Arabidopsis that need to be further completed by 
including the other SDGs published in Plant Physiol paper and checked 
for the question markers. A second similar table will be necessary for 
maize proteins (Plant Physiol paper) by including name, chromdb name, 
synonyms, accession. A third table will be on rice proteins by 
including name, chromdb name, synonyms, accession, and ESTs. The final 
name needs adjusted according to tree results.

After completing all Arabidopsis, maize and rice proteins, the 
phylogenic analysis can be performed by including the yeast and animal 
representatives that you had already and in addition by adding ScSET3, 
ScSET4 and MmSET7/9 as used in Plant Physiol paper.

Domain presentation can be followed only after the tree has been 
properly established. I may give detailed suggestions later.

With my best wishes,

Wen-Hui Shen</tt></pre><br><br>
