			Bootstrap Confidence Limits


 Random number generator seed =     111

 Number of bootstrap trials   =    1000


 Diagrammatic representation of the above tree: 

 Each row represents 1 tree cycle; defining 2 groups.

 Each column is 1 sequence; the stars in each line show 1 group; 
 the dots show the other

 Numbers show occurences in bootstrap samples.
