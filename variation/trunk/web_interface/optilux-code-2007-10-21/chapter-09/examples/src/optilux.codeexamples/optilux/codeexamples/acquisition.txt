Examples of acquisition
=======================

This doctest uses PloneTestCase to set up a Plone site. The variable
self.folder refers to a folder.

Let us create an object 'favorites' in the root of the portal and show that
using implicit acquisition, it can be acquired from self.folder, which is
also a folder inside the portal.

    >>> self.setRoles(('Manager',))
    >>> _ = self.portal.invokeFactory('Document', 'favorites')
    >>> favorites = getattr(self.portal, 'favorites')
    
    >>> from Acquisition import aq_base
    >>> acquiring = getattr(self.folder, 'favorites', None)
    >>> aq_base(acquiring) is aq_base(favorites)
    True
    
We can make acquisition explicit, however:
    
    >>> non_acquiring = getattr(self.folder.aq_explicit, 'favorites', None)
    >>> non_acquiring is None
    True
    
We can also acquire attributes:

    >>> getattr(self.folder, 'some_attribute', None) is None
    True

    >>> self.portal.some_attribute = 1
    >>> getattr(self.folder, 'some_attribute', None)
    1

When we acquire objects that are themselves acquisition-aware, we can 
inspect their acquisition chain.

    >>> from Acquisition import aq_chain, aq_inner
    >>> aq_chain(self.portal.favorites)
    [<ATDocument at /plone/favorites>, <PloneSite at /plone>, <Application at >, <ZPublisher.BaseRequest.RequestContainer object at ...>]
    
    >>> aq_chain(self.folder.favorites)
    [<ATDocument at /plone/favorites used for /plone/Members/test_user_1_>, <ATFolder at /plone/Members/test_user_1_>, <ATBTreeFolder at /plone/Members>, <PloneSite at /plone>, <Application at >, <ZPublisher.BaseRequest.RequestContainer object at ...>]

Note that we can explicitly request the innermost chain, which is normally the
containment chain:

    >>> aq_chain(aq_inner(self.portal.favorites))
    [<ATDocument at /plone/favorites>, <PloneSite at /plone>, <Application at >, <ZPublisher.BaseRequest.RequestContainer object at ...>]

Notice how the chain for 'favorites' is different depending on where it was
actually acquired from!

If we need to, we can play with the acquisition chain ourselves. Below, we
instantiate an object in memory without connecting it to the containment
hierarchy and then wrap it temporarily in the context of an object that
*is* in the containment hierarchy. This would, for example, let the temporary
object be subject to proper Zope 2 security.

    >>> from Products.ATContentTypes.content.document import ATDocument
    >>> temp_document = ATDocument('temp_document')
    >>> aq_chain(temp_document)
    [<ATDocument at temp_document>]
    >>> aq_chain(temp_document.__of__(self.portal))
    [<ATDocument at /plone/temp_document>, <PloneSite at /plone>, <Application at >, <ZPublisher.BaseRequest.RequestContainer object at ...>]

Of course, the object isn't really there:

    >>> 'temp_document' in self.portal.objectIds()
    False
