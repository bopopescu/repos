  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used by humans for millennia to make wine, beer and bread. More recently, it became a key model organism for studies of eukaryotic biology and for genomic analysis. However, relatively little is known about the natural lifestyle and population genetics of yeast. One major question is whether genetically diverse yeast strains mate and recombine in the wild. We developed a method to infer the evolutionary history of a species from genome sequences of multiple individuals and applied it to whole-genome sequence data from three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the sister species Saccharomyces paradoxus. We observed a pattern of sequence variation among yeast strains in which ancestral recombination events lead to a mosaic of segments with shared genealogy. Based on sequence divergence and the inferred median size of shared segments (approximately 2,000 bp), we estimated that although any two strains have undergone approximately 16 million cell divisions since their last common ancestor, only 314 outcrossing events have occurred during this time (roughly one every 50,000 divisions). Local correlations in polymorphism rates indicate that linkage disequilibrium in yeast should extend over kilobases. Our results provide the initial foundation for population studies of association between genotype and phenotype in S. cerevisiae. },

  title = {Population genetics of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus.},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Saccharomyces paradoxus is the closest known relative of the well-known S. cerevisiae and an attractive model organism for population genetic and genomic studies. Here we characterize a set of 28 wild isolates from a 10-km(2) sampling area in southern England. All 28 isolates are homothallic (capable of mating-type switching) and wild type with respect to nutrient requirements. Nine wild isolates and two lab strains of S. paradoxus were surveyed for sequence variation at six loci totaling 7 kb, and all 28 wild isolates were then genotyped at seven polymorphic loci. These data were used to calculate nucleotide diversity and number of segregating sites in S. paradoxus and to investigate geographic differentiation, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium. Synonymous site diversity is approximately 0.3\%. Extensive incompatibilities between gene genealogies indicate frequent recombination between unlinked loci, but there is no evidence of recombination within genes. Some localized clonal growth is apparent. The frequency of outcrossing relative to inbreeding is estimated at 1.1\% on the basis of heterozygosity. Thus, all three modes of reproduction known in the lab (clonal replication, inbreeding, and outcrossing) have been important in molding genetic variation in this species. },

  year = {2000},
  abstract = {It is shown that partial self-fertilization can be introduced into neutral population genetic models with recombination as a simple change in the scaling of the parameters. This means that statistical and computational methods that have been developed under the assumption of random mating can be used without modification, provided the appropriate parameter changes are made. An important prediction is that all forms of linkage disequilibrium will be more extensive in selfing species. The implications of this are discussed. },

  year = {1997},
  abstract = {A method of estimating the selfing rate using DNA sequence data was recently proposed by Milligan. Unfortunately, a number of errors make interpretation of his results problematic. In the present paper we first show how the usual coalescent process can be adapted to models that include selfing, and then use this result to find moment estimators as well as the likelihood surface for the selfing rate, s, and the scaled mutation rate, theta. We conclude that, regardless of the method used, large sample sizes are necessary to estimate s with any degree of certainty, and that the estimate is always highly sensitive to recent changes in the true value. },

  title = {Inferring recent outcrossing rates using multilocus individual heterozygosity: application to evolving wheat populations.},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {Using multilocus individual heterozygosity, a method is developed to estimate the outcrossing rates of a population over a few previous generations. Considering that individuals originate either from outcrossing or from n successive selfing generations from an outbred ancestor, a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator is described that gives estimates of past outcrossing rates in terms of proportions of individuals with different n values. Heterozygosities at several unlinked codominant loci are used to assign n values to each individual. This method also allows a test of whether populations are in inbreeding equilibrium. The estimator's reliability was checked using simulations for different mating histories. We show that this ML estimator can provide estimates of outcrossing rates for the final generation outcrossing rate (t(0)) and a mean of the preceding rates (t(p)) and can detect major temporal variation in the mating system. The method is most efficient for low to intermediate outcrossing levels. Applied to nine populations of wheat, this method gave estimates of t(0) and t(p). These estimates confirmed the absence of outcrossing t(0) = 0 in the two populations subjected to manual selfing. For free-mating wheat populations, it detected lower final generation outcrossing rates t(0) = 0-0.06 than those expected from global heterozygosity t = 0.02-0.09. This estimator appears to be a new and efficient way to describe the multilocus heterozygosity of a population, complementary to Fis and progeny analysis approaches. },

  abstract = {We resequenced 876 short fragments in a sample of 96 individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that included stock center accessions as well as a hierarchical sample from natural populations. Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed, the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed, sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide, although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles, at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions, attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions. Despite this, our data support the utility of A. thaliana as a model for evolutionary functional genomics.},
