  abstract = {We introduce a new Bayesian clustering algorithm for studying population structure using individually geo-referenced multilocus data sets. The algorithm is based on the concept of hidden Markov random field, which models the spatial dependencies at the cluster membership level. We argue that (i) a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure can implement the algorithm efficiently, (ii) it can detect significant geographical discontinuities in allele frequencies and regulate the number of clusters, (iii) it can check whether the clusters obtained without the use of spatial priors are robust to the hypothesis of discontinuous geographical variation in allele frequencies, and (iv) it can reduce the number of loci required to obtain accurate assignments. We illustrate and discuss the implementation issues with the Scandinavian brown bear and the human CEPH diversity panel data set.},

  abstract = {An analysis is made of the distribution of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions with k alleles and of estimates of inbreeding coefficients (f) obtained from these deviations.--If f is small, the best estimate of f in large samples is shown to be 2[Sigma] i(Tii/Ni)/(k - 1), where Tii is an unbiased measure of the excess of the ith homozygote and Ni the number of the ith allele in the sample [frequency = Ni/(2N)]. No extra information is obtained from the Tij, where these are departures of numbers of heterozygotes from expectation. Alternatively, the best estimator can be computed from the Tij, ignoring the Tii. Also (1) the variance of the estimate of f equals 1/(N(k - 1)) when all individuals in the sample are unrelated, and the test for f = 0 with 1 d.f. is given by the ratio of the estimate to its standard error; (2) the variance is reduced if some alleles are rare; and (3) if the sample consists of full-sib families of size n, the variance is increased by a proportion (n - 1)/4 but is not increased by a half-sib relationship.--If f is not small, the structure of the population is of critical importance. (1) If the inbreeding is due to a proportion of inbred matings in an otherwise random-breeding population, f as determined from homozygote excess is the same for all genes and expressions are given for its sampling variance. (2) If the homozygote excess is due to population admixture, f is not the same for all genes. The above estimator is probably close to the best for all f values.},

We provide information about the breeding system of the perennial yellow bush lupine, Lupinus arboreus, specifically determining self-compatibility, outcrossing rate, and level of inbreeding depression. Flowers are self-compatible, but autonomous self-fertilization rarely occurs; thus selfed seed are a product of facilitated selfing. Based on four isozyme loci from 34 maternal progeny arrays of seeds we estimated an outcrossing rate of 0.78. However, when we accounted for differential maturation of selfed seeds, the outcrossing rate at fertilization was lower, 0.64. Fitness and inbreeding depression of 11 selfed and outcrossed families were measured at four stages: seed maturation, seedling emergence, seedling survivorship, and growth at 12 wk. Cumulative inbreeding depression across all four life stages averaged 0.59, although variation existed between families for the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression was not manifest uniformly across all four life stages. Outcrossed flowers produced twice as many seeds as selfed flowers, but the mean performance of selfed and outcrossed progeny was not different for emergence, seedling survivorship, and size at 12 wk. Counter to assumptions about this species, L. arboreus is both self-compatible and outcrosses 78\% of the time.},

Adult snails were sampled during the spring breeding period, allowing for prior copulations and sperm transfer under natural conditions. Once in the laboratory, they were kept isolated for 21 days and laid egg capsules, and emerging hatchlings from 42 families were scored for five polymorphic loci. 87 of 848 offspring exhibited non-maternal alleles, representing a minimum population-level outcrossing of 10.3\%. Maximum likelihood estimates are in the range 13-15\%. Importantly, there is significant among-family heterogeneity, as only 16 of 42 families are estimated to have outcrossed, in accord with high estimates of correlated selfing within progeny arrays. Moreover, the high proportion of full sibs among outcrossed sibs suggests a limited extent of multiple paternity. Our data reveal important heterogeneity in the mating system of an animal hermaphrodite, and indicate the potential for evolutionary change in the breeding system.},

(Lima bean) populations, ranging in sizes from 10 to 60 reproductive individuals, we estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and parental inbreeding coefficient (F). We also examined the relationship between outcrossing rate and population size. Average estimates of the single-locus outcrossing rate (ts) ranged from 0.024 to 0.246 (mean=0.091+/-0.065). Estimates of the multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) ranged from 0.027 to 0.268, and averaged 0.096+/-0.071. Inbreeding coefficients based on genotypic frequencies of maternal plants were positive and significantly greater than zero (F=0.504), suggesting an excess of homozygotes in all the populations studied. There was indirect evidence of nonrandom mating for outcrosses and this was mainly attributed to self-fertilisation since the averaged difference between tm and ts, which provides a measure of biparental inbreeding, represents only 1\% of the autogamy rate. No significant correlation was observed between outcrossing rate and population size. Estimates of t showed significant heterogeneity among populations and factors explaining this tendency are suggested. },

We studied flower visitors in a natural population of the species. Solitary bees, diptera and thrips are among the most frequently observed insects among the surprising diversity of insects visiting flowers of A. thaliana. Assuming that every visit equals an outcrossing event, the outcrossing rate was estimated to be 0.84 \%. This value falls between estimations of outcrossing rates from molecular data and those of artificial systems. Despite the rather low rate of flower visitation, A. thaliana can no longer be regarded as a completely self-pollinated plant species in the wild. This observation may explain recombination events observed in molecular analyses. Possible pollen transfer between populations due to the mobility of the observed insects should be considered in population genetic analyses.},

A total of 170 of the 6321 nucleotides surveyed were polymorphic, with 169 being biallelic. The mean silent genetic diversity ({pi}s) varied between 0.001 and 0.03. Pairwise linkage disequilibria between the polymorphisms were negatively correlated with distance, although this effect vanished when only pairs of polymorphisms with four haplotypes were included in the analysis. The absence of a consistent negative correlation between distance and linkage disequilibrium indicated that gene conversion might have played an important role in distributing genetic diversity throughout the region. We tested this by coalescent simulations and estimate that up to 90\% of recombination is due to gene conversion.},

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {Mixed-mating animals self-fertilize a proportion of their offspring. Outcrossing rate may covary with the ecological and historical factors affecting the population. Theory predicts that outcrossing is favored when inbreeding depression is high and when individual heterozygosity is important. Self-fertilization is predicted to be favored when costs of male function, or mate finding are high, for example, when empty patches are colonized by few individuals. In this study, we assessed primary (after hatching) and secondary (after juvenile mortality) outcrossing rates of two mixed-mating snail populations. Our purpose was to assess the variation in mating-system parameters and estimate significance of inbreeding depression for secondary outcrossing rate (the realized outcrossing rate of parents that produce the next generation). Secondary outcrossing rate was higher than the primary outcrossing rate in one of the two populations, suggesting considerable inbreeding depression. In the other study population, secondary outcrossing rates were found to increase when initially low, or decrease when initially high, depending on the family. Moderate outcrossing rates were found to be more stable. Parental inbreeding coefficients were close to zero in both populations. Outcrossing rate was much more variable among families in the population with the lower average outcrossing rate, suggesting that individuals differed considerably in their mating system. Our results add to recent studies suggesting that populations of mixed-mating animals may differ in their mating system parameters and expression of inbreeding depression. },

In the selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana, pseudogenes at the SCR and SRK self-incompatibility loci are believed to underlie the evolution of self-fertilization. Positive directional selection has driven the evolutionary fixation of pseudogene alleles of SCR, leading to substantially reduced nucleotide variation. Coalescent simulations indicate that this adaptive event may have occurred very recently and is possibly associated with the post-Pleistocene expansion of A. thaliana from glacial refugia. This suggests that ancillary morphological innovations associated with self-pollination can evolve rapidly after the inactivation of the self-incompatibility response.},

More recently, it became a key model organism for studies of eukaryotic biology and for genomic analysis. However, relatively little is known about the natural lifestyle and population genetics of yeast. One major question is whether genetically diverse yeast strains mate and recombine in the wild. We developed a method to infer the evolutionary history of a species from genome sequences of multiple individuals and applied it to whole-genome sequence data from three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the sister species Saccharomyces paradoxus. We observed a pattern of sequence variation among yeast strains in which ancestral recombination events lead to a mosaic of segments with shared genealogy. Based on sequence divergence and the inferred median size of shared segments (approximately 2,000 bp), we estimated that although any two strains have undergone approximately 16 million cell divisions since their last common ancestor, only 314 outcrossing events have occurred during this time (roughly one every 50,000 divisions). Local correlations in polymorphism rates indicate that linkage disequilibrium in yeast should extend over kilobases. Our results provide the initial foundation for population studies of association between genotype and phenotype in S. cerevisiae. },

Here we characterize a set of 28 wild isolates from a 10-km(2) sampling area in southern England. All 28 isolates are homothallic (capable of mating-type switching) and wild type with respect to nutrient requirements. Nine wild isolates and two lab strains of S. paradoxus were surveyed for sequence variation at six loci totaling 7 kb, and all 28 wild isolates were then genotyped at seven polymorphic loci. These data were used to calculate nucleotide diversity and number of segregating sites in S. paradoxus and to investigate geographic differentiation, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium. Synonymous site diversity is approximately 0.3\%. Extensive incompatibilities between gene genealogies indicate frequent recombination between unlinked loci, but there is no evidence of recombination within genes. Some localized clonal growth is apparent. The frequency of outcrossing relative to inbreeding is estimated at 1.1\% on the basis of heterozygosity. Thus, all three modes of reproduction known in the lab (clonal replication, inbreeding, and outcrossing) have been important in molding genetic variation in this species. },

  year = {2000},
  abstract = {Using multilocus individual heterozygosity, a method is developed to estimate the outcrossing rates of a population over a few previous generations. Considering that individuals originate either from outcrossing or from n successive selfing generations from an outbred ancestor, a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator is described that gives estimates of past outcrossing rates in terms of proportions of individuals with different n values. Heterozygosities at several unlinked codominant loci are used to assign n values to each individual. This method also allows a test of whether populations are in inbreeding equilibrium. The estimator's reliability was checked using simulations for different mating histories. We show that this ML estimator can provide estimates of outcrossing rates for the final generation outcrossing rate (t(0)) and a mean of the preceding rates (t(p)) and can detect major temporal variation in the mating system. The method is most efficient for low to intermediate outcrossing levels. Applied to nine populations of wheat, this method gave estimates of t(0) and t(p). These estimates confirmed the absence of outcrossing t(0) = 0 in the two populations subjected to manual selfing. For free-mating wheat populations, it detected lower final generation outcrossing rates t(0) = 0-0.06 than those expected from global heterozygosity t = 0.02-0.09. This estimator appears to be a new and efficient way to describe the multilocus heterozygosity of a population, complementary to Fis and progeny analysis approaches. },

This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping.

The model assumes that the number of demes within each population or species is large. When populations (or species), connected either by gene flow or historical association, are themselves subdivided into demes, changes in the migration rate among demes alter both the structure of genealogies and the time scale of the coalescent process. The time scale of the coalescent is related to the effective size of the population, which depends on the migration rate among demes. When the migration rate among demes within populations is low, isolation (or speciation) events seem more recent and migration rates among populations seem higher because the effective size of each population is increased. This affects the probability of reciprocal monophyly of two samples, the chance that a gene tree of a sample matches the species tree, and relative likelihoods of different types of polymorphic sites. It can also have a profound effect on the estimation of divergence times.Corresponding Editor: J. Neigel},

However, Wahlund effects may also arise due to recolonisations from different source populations after bottleneck events. A breeding experiment helped to disentangle the mating system and the Wahlund effects, and showed that high levels of selfing occurred in isolation and in controlled pairings.

  abstract = {Breeding systems are important, and often neglected, aspects of the natural biology of organisms, affecting homozygosity and thus many aspects of their biology, including levels and patterns of genetic diversity and genome evolution. Among the different plant mating systems, it is useful to distinguish two types of systems: `sex systems', hermaphroditic versus male/female and other situations; and the `mating systems' of hermaphroditic populations, inbreeding, outcrossing or intermediate. Evolutionary changes in breeding systems occur between closely related species, and some changes occur more often than others. Understanding why such changes occur requires combined genetical and ecological approaches. I review the ideas of some of the most important theoretical models, showing how these are based on individual selection using genetic principles to ask whether alleles affecting plants' outcrossing rates or sex morphs will spread in populations. After discussing how the conclusions are affected by some of the many relevant ecological factors, I relate these theoretical ideas to empirical data from some of the many recent breeding system studies in plant populations.},

Statistical estimation of the outcrossing rate has relied on a model of the mating process that assumes that successive outcross events within a family arise from independent draws of pollen from the total population of male plants. Although this assumption is likely to be most appropriate for wind-pollinated plants, it is not appropriate in certain insect-pollinated plants. An alternative model is developed that assumes that successive outcross events within a family involve pollen drawn from a single male parent. The estimation of the parameters that index this model is outlined and a procedure for calculating the variances of the parameter estimates is presented. Monte Carlo simulations of the sampling processes assumed by each model are also presented. The simulations show that application of the incorrect estimation model to data can lead to a large bias in parameter estimates. },

The model separates the correlation of selfing from the correlation of outcrossed paternal alleles and is an approach to paternity analysis suited for larger populations with fewer marker loci. Its parameters determine the components of genetic covariance between sibs and provide information about the average number of fathers in a maternal sibship. Electrophoretic markers were used to obtain estimates of correlated matings for two Mimulus guttatus populations. In both populations, about 50\% selfing was observed. For two sibs randomly selected from the same capsule, the correlations of selfing between these sibs were 17\% and 12\% in the two populations, and the correlations of paternity (the proportion of full-sibs among outcrossed sib-pairs) were 37\% and 44\%. Sibs from different capsules were not correlated for selfing, and the paternity correlation dropped to near 20\% in both populations. However, estimates of correlated matings have high variance, lack statistical independence, and can be difficult to obtain. The use of marker loci with many alleles can alleviate these problems.},

The proportion of effective self-fertilization is termed the "effective selfing rate," and it is specified with identity coefficients. The description of the offspring genotypic distribution for a population with mating among relatives requires a set of three independent parameters of genetic and mating structure. One such set is the inbreeding coefficient of parents, the coefficient of kinship between mates and the effective selfing rate. The model used to derive the effective selfing rate distinguishes between the effective selfing rates of inbred vs. outbred parents; the mixed mating model does not distinguish between these two rates. As a result, the mixed mating model usually gives biased estimates of effective selfing, if there is mating among inbred relatives. The procedure for estimation of effective selfing, based upon progeny array data distributed according to the "effective selfing model," is presented, and an example is given. },

Two examples are given in which the new estimators are applied to natural populations, one that reveals isolation-by-distance in an annual plant and the other that suggests a genetic basis for a coat color polymorphism in bears. },

Variation at two levels is considered: among pairs of individuals within populations, and among pairs of subpopulations within a population. In the former, inferred pairwise relatedness, combined with trait measures, allow estimates of heritability 'in the wild'. In the latter, estimates of QST are obtained, in the absence of known heritabilities, via estimates of pairwise FST. Estimators of relatedness based on the 'Kronecker operator' are given. Both methods require actual variation of relationship, a rarely studied aspect of population structure, and not necessarily present. Some conditions for appropriate population structures in the wild are identified, in part through a review of recent studies. },

The estimates show that selection was intense at various stages of the life cycle and that viability and fertility components often opposed one another. Estimates of viability and fertility components of selection were also extended to the three-locus level. The multilocus estimates reveal large differences in viability and fertility among homozygous genotypes. It is concluded that strong selection operates at all life cycle stages in CCV, although often in differing directions. },

  abstract = {Nonrandom mating induces correlations in allelic states within and among loci that can be exploited to understand the genetic structure of natural populations (WRIGHT 1965). For many species, it is of considerable interest to quantify the contribution of two forms of nonrandom mating to patterns of standing genetic variation: inbreeding (mating among relatives) and population substructure (limited dispersal of gametes). Here, we extend the popular Bayesian clustering approach STRUCTURE (PRITCHARD et al. 2000) for simultaneous inference of inbreeding or selfing rates and population-of-origin classification using multilocus genetic markers. This is accomplished by eliminating the assumption of HardyWeinberg equilibrium within clusters and, instead, calculating expected genotype frequencies on the basis of inbreeding or selfing rates. We demonstrate the need for such an extension by showing that selfing leads to spurious signals of population substructure using the standard STRUCTURE algorithm with a bias toward spurious signals of admixture. We gauge the performance of our method using extensive coalescent simulations and demonstrate that our approach can correct for this bias. We also apply our approach to understanding the population structure of the wild relative of domesticated rice, Oryza rufipogon, an important partially selfing grass species. Using a sample of n = 16 individuals sequenced at 111 random loci, we find strong evidence for existence of two subpopulations, which correlates well with geographic location of sampling, and estimate selfing rates for both groups that are consistent with estimates from experimental data (s {approx} 0.480.70).},

  abstract = {Some stochastic theory is developed for monoecious populations of size N in which there are probabilities {beta} and 1 - {beta} of reproduction by selfing and by random mating. It is assumed that {beta} >> N-1. Expressions are derived for the inbreeding coefficient of one random individual and the coefficient of kinship of two random separate individuals at time t. The mean and between-lines variance of the fraction of copies of a locus that are identical in two random separate individuals in an equilibrium population are obtained under the assumption that there is an infinite number of possible alleles. It is found that the theory for random mating populations holds if the effective population number is Ne = N'/(1 + FIS), where FIS is the inbreeding coefficient at equilibrium when N is infinite and N' is the reciprocal of the probability that two gametes contributing to random separate adults come from the same parent. When there is a binomial distribution of successful gametes emanating from each adult, N' = N. An approximation to the probability that an allele A survives if it is originally present in one A[Amacr] heterozygote is found to be 2(N'/N)( FISs1 + (1 - FIS) s2), where s1 and s2 are the selective advantages of AA and A[Amacr] in comparison with [Amacr][Amacr]. In the last section it is shown that if there is partial full sib mating and binomial offspring distributions N e = N/(1 + 3FIS).},

Generic definitions of inbreeding coefficients are given, as ratios of differences of probabilities of identity in state. Then some of their properties are derived from an assumption in terms of differences between distributions of coalescence times of different genes. These inbreeding coefficients give an approximate measurement of how much higher the probability of recent coalescence is for some pair of genes relative to another pair. Such a measure is in general not equivalent to identity by descent; rather, it approximates a ratio of differences of probabilities of identity by descent. These results are contrasted with some other formulas relating identity, allele frequency, and inbreeding coefficients. Additional assumptions are necessary to obtain most of them, and some of these assumptions are not always correct, for example when there is localized dispersal. Therefore, definitions based on such formulas are not always well-formulated. By contrast, the generic definitions are both well-formulated and more broadly applicable. },

By using the relationship between coalescence times and identity probabilities, it is possible to extend existing results for inbreeding coefficients in regular systems of mating to find the distribution of coalescence times and the mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express Sewall Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of models of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to find FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations, M, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data. },

  abstract = {Populations often have very complex hierarchical structure. Therefore, it is crucial in genetic monitoring and conservation biology to have a reliable estimate of the pattern of population subdivision. FSTs for pairs of sampled localities or subpopulations are crucial statistics for the exploratory analysis of population structures, such as cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. However, the estimation of FST is not precise enough to reliably estimate the population structure and the extent of heterogeneity. This paper proposes an empirical Bayes procedure to estimate locus-specific pairwise FSTs. The posterior mean of the pairwise FST can be interpreted as a shrinkage estimator, which reduces the variance of conventional estimators largely at the expense of a small bias. The global FST of a population generally varies among loci in the genome. Our maximum likelihood estimates of global FSTs can be used as sufficient statistics to estimate the distribution of FST in the genome. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our model by simulation and by an analysis of the microsatellite allele frequencies of the Pacific herring. The heterogeneity of the global FST in the genome is discussed based on the estimated distribution of the global FST for the herring and examples of human SNPs.},

However, until very recently, population structure has not been taken into account, even though it can be an important factor in the evolution of populations. Population subdivision modifies the dynamics of deleterious mutations because the outcome of selection depends on processes both within populations (selection and drift) and between populations (migration). Here, we present a general model that permits us to gain insight into patterns of inbreeding depression, heterosis, and the load in subdivided populations. We show that they can be interpreted with reference to single-population theory, using an appropriate local effective population size that integrates the effects of drift, selection, and migration. We term this the "effective population size of selection" (NS(e)). For the infinite island model, for example, it is equal to NS(e) = N1 + m/hs, where N is the local population size, m the migration rate, and h and s the dominance and selection coefficients of deleterious mutation. Our results have implications for the estimation and interpretation of inbreeding depression in subdivided populations, especially regarding conservation issues. We also discuss the possible effects of migration and subdivision on the evolution of mating systems. },

Here we provide an overview of reproductive traits in hermaphroditic animal species, review the distribution of selfing rates in animals, and test for ecological correlates of selfing. Our dataset (1342 selfing-rate estimates for 142 species) is 97\% based on estimates derived from the analysis of population structure (F(IS)-estimates)using genetic markers. The distribution of selfing is slightly U-shaped and differs significantly from the more strongly U-shaped plant distribution with 47\% of animal t-estimates being intermediate (falling between 0.2 and 0.8) compared to 42\% for plants. The influence of several factors on the distribution of selfing rates was explored (e.g., number of populations studied per species, habitat, coloniality, sessility, or fertilization type), none of which significantly affect the distribution. Our results suggest that genetic forces might contribute to the evolution of self-fertilization to the same extent in animals and plants, although the high proportion of intermediate outcrossing suggests a significant role of ecological factors (e.g., reproductive assurance)in animals. However, we caution that the distribution of selfing rates in animals is affected by various factors that might bias F(IS)-estimates, including phylogenetic underrepresentation of highly selfing and outcrossing species, various genotyping errors (e.g., null alleles) and inbreeding depression. This highlights the necessity of obtaining better estimates of selfing for hermaphroditic animals, such as genotyping progeny arrays, as in plants. },

Fourteen of the populations were polymorphic for PGI genotype, and progeny arrays of adults from these populations provided observations from which mating system parameters were estimated. These estimates were in agreement with earlier studies in indicating that the normal rate of outcrossing in this fescue is much less than 1\%. However, a remarkable high rate of outcrossing ($backslashhat{t}$ = 0.067) was observed in a single generation of one population, followed by return to the normal very low rate $backslashhat{t}$ < 0.01) in the next generation. This observation demonstrates that rare bursts of outcrossing occur in this species, a fact that may aid in understanding the substantial genetic variability that exists in populations of small fescue.},

  abstract = {The role that inbreeding and coancestry play in the distribution of neutral genes is incorporated into the variance of a linear function to provide a simple cumulative expression of the variance among mean gene frequencies of groups of individuals. The total variance of gene frequencies is subdivided into components corresponding to genes within individuals, among individuals within groups, and among groups. Various intraclass correlations, some of which may be negative, of gene frequencies are formulated. The various types of parameters are considered for and extended to include further structuring of the population, separate sexes, systems of mating, and effective numbers. Estimators and tests of hypotheses for the parameters are developed.},

  abstract = {A distance measure for populations diverging by drift only is based on the coancestry coefficient [theta], and three estimators of the distance D = -ln(1 - [theta]) are constructed for multiallelic, multilocus data. Simulations of a monoecious population mating at random showed that a weighted ratio of single-locus estimators performed better than an unweighted average or a least squares estimator. Jackknifing over loci provided satisfactory variance estimates of distance values. In the drift situation, in which mutation is excluded, the weighted estimator of D appears to be a better measure of distance than others that have appeared in the literature.},

  title = {The impact of missing and erroneous genotypes on tagging SNP selection and power of subsequent association tests.},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) serve as effective markers for localizing disease susceptibility genes, but current genotyping technologies are inadequate for genotyping all available SNP markers in a typical linkage/association study. Much attention has recently been paid to methods for selecting the minimal informative subset of SNPs in identifying haplotypes, but there has been little investigation of the effect of missing or erroneous genotypes on the performance of these SNP selection algorithms and subsequent association tests using the selected tagging SNPs. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of missing genotype or genotyping error on tagging SNP selection and subsequent single marker and haplotype association tests using the selected tagging SNPs. METHODS: Through two sets of simulations, we evaluated the performance of three tagging SNP selection programs in the presence of missing or erroneous genotypes: Clayton's diversity based program htstep, Carlson's linkage disequilibrium (LD) based program ldSelect, and Stram's coefficient of determination based program tagsnp.exe. RESULTS: When randomly selected known loci were relabeled as 'missing', we found that the average number of tagging SNPs selected by all three algorithms changed very little and the power of subsequent single marker and haplotype association tests using the selected tagging SNPs remained close to the power of these tests in the absence of missing genotype. When random genotyping errors were introduced, we found that the average number of tagging SNPs selected by all three algorithms increased. In data sets simulated according to the haplotype frequecies in the CYP19 region, Stram's program had larger increase than Carlson's and Clayton's programs. In data sets simulated under the coalescent model, Carlson's program had the largest increase and Clayton's program had the smallest increase. In both sets of simulations, with the presence of genotyping errors, the power of the haplotype tests from all three programs decreased quickly, but there was not much reduction in power of the single marker tests. CONCLUSIONS: Missing genotypes do not seem to have much impact on tagging SNP selection and subsequent single marker and haplotype association tests. In contrast, genotyping errors could have severe impact on tagging SNP selection and haplotype tests, but not on single marker tests. },

  abstract = {We resequenced 876 short fragments in a sample of 96 individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that included stock center accessions as well as a hierarchical sample from natural populations. Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed, the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed, sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide, although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles, at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions, attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions. Despite this, our data support the utility of A. thaliana as a model for evolutionary functional genomics.},

Recently, members of the Complex Trait Consortium proposed the development of a large panel of eight-way RILs in the mouse, derived from eight genetically diverse parental strains. Such a panel would be a valuable community resource. The use of such eight-way RILs will require a detailed understanding of the relationship between alleles at linked loci on an RI chromosome. We extend the work of Haldane and Waddington on two-way RILs and describe the map expansion, clustering of breakpoints, and other features of the genomes of multiple-strain RILs as a function of the level of crossover interference in meiosis. },

  abstract = {Inferences about plant mating systems increasingly use highly informative genetic markers, and investigate finer facets of the mating system. Here, four extensions of models for the estimation mating systems are described. (1) Multiallelic probabilities for the mixed selfing-random mating model are given; these are especially suitable for microsatellites; a generalized Kronecker operator is basis of this formula. (2) Multilocus probabilities for the "correlated-matings model" are given; interestingly, comparisons between single- vs multilocus estimates of correlated-paternity can provide a new measure of population substructure. (3) A measure of biparental inbreeding, the "correlation of selfing among loci", is shown to approximate the fraction of selfing due to uniparental (as opposed to biparental) inbreeding; also joint estimation of 1- 2- and 3-locus selfing rates allow separation, under a simple model, of the frequency vs the magnitude of biparental inbreeding. (4) Method-of-moments estimators for individual outcrossing rates are given. Formulae are given for both gymnosperms and angiosperms, and the computer program "MLTR" implements these methods. },

  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Western redcedar (Thuja plicata, Cupressaceae) is a self-fertile conifer with a mixed mating system and significant variation for outcrossing among populations. In this paper, we conducted a fine-scale study of mating system variation to identify correlates of outcrossing in natural populations. We examined variation for outcrossing within and among individual trees, and describe a new method to estimate outcrossing using bulked DNA samples. Bulking (assaying DNA tissues from several individuals simultaneously) increases the experimental power without increasing the experimental effort. We sampled 80 trees from four natural populations in southwestern British Columbia. From each tree, we sampled from up to six crown positions (three heights and inner vs outer branches). From each position, two samples of three seedlings each were bulked before DNA extractions. Using four microsatellite loci, we obtained outcrossing rates for each tree and for each of the six crown positions. We found individual tree selfing rates to increase with tree height in all four populations, but selfing rates did not differ among crown positions. The higher selfing rate of larger trees is probably due to their greater proportional contribution to local pollen clouds. Individual tree outcrossing rates ranged from 22 to 100\% and the population outcrossing rates from 66 to 78\%. Missed alleles due to bulking and the estimation method used both cause a downward bias in outcrossing rates, so that these estimates are probably lower than the actual outcrossing rates. Nevertheless, the trends we observed are not affected by systematic biases of estimation. },

  abstract = {The genus Centrosema includes several species both potentially and currently useful as pasture and fodder crops in tropical and subtropical areas. Genetic variability, population genetic structure, and the mating systems of three species of this genus, C. acutifolium, C. brasilianum, and C. pubescens have been studied using isozyme (17 loci) and DNA markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA and rDNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism). Both kinds of markers discriminate populations belonging to different species. Outcrossing rates and other experimental parameters have been determined in populations of an active germplasm collection outside the species native habitat. Populations of all three species showed relatively high polymorphism and heterozygosity, and total genetic diversity was higher within than between populations. The mating system parameters indicated that outcrossing was higher than expected in the three species, previously considered as being predominantly selfers. The multllocus analysis carried out in C. acutifolium provided estimations of the outcrossing rate ranging from 0.27 to 0.41 among populations; estimations carried out from the fixation Index in the other two species also suggested relatively high outcrossing rates. These species should be considered species with mixed mating systems, and this fact should be taken into consideration in further breeding programs and germplasm conservation.},

  abstract = {This study employed microsatellite loci to analyse outcrossing rate and pollen dispersal in Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) in an isolated stand. The average offspring outcrossing rate for 29 cones was 0.955. Significant differences in outcrossing rates between offspring groups on individual branches that extended in different directions at different heights were not detected. Male parents of 874 offspring collected from the maternal tree were assessed by exclusion using polymorphisms at three microsatellite loci. Paternity analysis indicated that at least 31\% of the offspring were fertilized by pollen from trees outside the stand. The average distance of pollen migration within the study stand was 68 m, with a maximum value of 325 m. There was excess mating with nearby P. densiflora trees, of which only a few were predominant pollen donors. In addition, a weakly directional bias in P. densiflora pollination was also detected in the study stand, suggesting that female strobili on a branch of the maternal tree were more easily fertilized by pollen from trees in that direction. },

Some tests are found to be close to optimal for the detection of inbreeding or heterozygote excess, one of which is a score test closely related to Robertson and Hill's estimator of the inbreeding coefficient. This test is also easily applied to multiple samples. Such tests are not always the most appropriate if alternative hypotheses differ from those considered here. },
