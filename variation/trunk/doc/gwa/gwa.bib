  abstract = {In most microarray technologies, a number of critical steps are required to convert raw intensity measurements into the data relied upon by data analysts, biologists, and clinicians. These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing, can influence the quality of the ultimate measurements. In the last few years, the high-throughput measurement of gene expression is the most popular application of microarray technology. For this application, various groups have demonstrated that the use of modern statistical methodology can substantially improve accuracy and precision of the gene expression measurements, relative to ad hoc procedures introduced by designers and manufacturers of the technology. Currently, other applications of microarrays are becoming more and more popular. In this paper, we describe a preprocessing methodology for a technology designed for the identification of DNA sequence variants in specific genes or regions of the human genome that are associated with phenotypes of interest such as disease. In particular, we describe a methodology useful for preprocessing Affymetrix single-nucleotide polymorphism chips and obtaining genotype calls with the preprocessed data. We demonstrate how our procedure improves existing approaches using data from 3 relatively large studies including the one in which large numbers of independent calls are available. The proposed methods are implemented in the package oligo available from Bioconductor.},

  title = {A comparison of normalization methods for high density oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias},
  year = {2003},
  URL = {http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/185},
  abstract = {Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;\&amp;lt;p\&amp;gt;The genomes of individuals from the same species vary in sequence as a result of different evolutionary processes. To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and []4\% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in A. thaliana.\&amp;lt;/p\&amp;gt;\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;We resequenced 876 short fragments in a sample of 96 individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that included stock center accessions as well as a hierarchical sample from natural populations. Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed, the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed, sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide, although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles, at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions, attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions. Despite this, our data support the utility of A. thaliana as a model for evolutionary functional genomics.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  title = {Inferring missing genotypes in large {SNP} panels using fast nearest-neighbor searches over sliding windows.},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;MOTIVATION: Typical high-throughput genotyping techniques produce numerous missing calls that confound subsequent analyses, such as disease association studies. Common remedies for this problem include removing affected markers and/or samples or, otherwise, imputing the missing data. On small marker sets imputation is frequently based on a vote of the K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) haplotypes, but this technique is neither practical nor justifiable for large datasets. RESULTS: We describe a data structure that supports efficient KNN queries over arbitrarily sized, sliding haplotype windows, and evaluate its use for genotype imputation. The performance of our method enables exhaustive exploration over all window sizes and known sites in large (150K, 8.3M) SNP panels. We also compare the accuracy and performance of our methods with competing imputation approaches. AVAILABILITY: A free open source software package, NPUTE, is available at http://compgen.unc.edu/software, for non-commercial uses.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  title = {A fast and flexible statistical model for large-scale population genotype data: applications to inferring missing genotypes and haplotypic phase.},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {We present a statistical model for patterns of genetic variation in samples of unrelated individuals from natural populations. This model is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population tend to cluster into groupsof similar haplotypes. To capture the fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach is flexible, allowing for both \&quot;block-like\&quot; patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance. The resulting modelis also fast and, as a result, is practicable for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude duPolymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch error was 0.055for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates, in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens Lab Web site.},
