This bundle consists of three utilities, cel_qnorm_pass1, cel_p1readtest and gtype_cel_to_pq.
All of them can process gz'ed/bz2'ed CEL files directly where applicable.

DESCRIPTION
===========

cel_qnorm_pass1:
   usage:     cel_qnorm_pass1 -o refintfile *.CEL.bz2
   purpose:    Generates a reference intensity array from mean quantile 

cel_p1readtest:
   usage:     cel_p1readtest -i refintfile
   purpose:   (for testing) print the reference intensity array in human 
              readable form.
gtype_cel_to_pq:
   It is the same tool from Affymetrix, except with two changes (in addition to 
   being able to process gz'ed/bz'ed CEL files):
   (1) (incompatible change) it also outputs the stdv, next to the individual
        probe intensities.
   (2) (compatible change) new option "-refintensity <file>" to load
       the reference array and output quantile-normalized intensities.

CAVEAT
======
The refintfile is essentially a memory dump of an array of doubles, and is highly
non-portable between endian's and architecture. Please do not try running pass 1 and
pass 2 on different platforms (yet).

KNOWN LIMITATION
================
The tool for first pass currently uses shell-expansion for multiple cel files
and therefore limited by max command length. (in the most optimal cases, over 
1000, so should be enough for the time being) - will probably change/add to read 
file list from file instead in the future.
